# menagerie-mysql-pd-demo
This is a crude Python demo program and Jupyter notebook used to demonstrate Pandas, MySQL interactions, etc. It can be a "jumping-off point" for further development, requirements gathering, etc.

## How Do I Use This Demo?

* **Clone this repository**: `git clone https://github.com/babalugats76/menagerie-mysql-pd-demo.git`
* **Install requirements** (optional): 
* **Create an `.env` file** in the cloned project directory of the following form:
```
MYSQL_HOST=xxxxxx.xxxxx.xxxxxx
MYSQL_PORT=3306
MYSQL_USER=xxxxx
MYSQL_PASSWORD=xxxxx
MYSQL_DATABASE=xxxxx
```
* Run `pets.ipynb` which basically just wraps a call to `%run pets.py`
* Review `pets.py` in detail
